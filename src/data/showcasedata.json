    "project_summary": "The project is a Risk Assessment Model which follows the Risk Formula, Risk = Hazard X Vulnerability X Exposure, to compute the risk score and corresponding activation level for a Tropical Cyclone. The model utilizes population data, poverty indices, and tropical cyclone intensity as its variables for Exposure, Vulnerability, and Hazard, respectively. Using these set of variables, the model will compute the risk scores of specific provinces/boundaries which determines the activation level for a Tropical Cyclone affecting the country.",
