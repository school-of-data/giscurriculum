# Module 1 - Introduction to QGIS

**Author**: Ben Hur

## Pedagogical Introduction

This module serves as an introduction to QGIS. At the end of this module, learners should be familiar with:

- what QGIS is
- QGIS interface
- QGIS settings
- QGIS plugins

They should also learn:

- how to install and open QGIS
- the different parts and features of the QGIS interface
- how to edit the interface layout and theme
- the different QGIS settings, how to change them, and how they affect QGIS
- what user profiles are and how use them
- what plugins are and how to install them

The module will also discuss some nuances of QGIS and what makes it unique or different from other GIS such as QGIS file formats.

## Required tools and resources

The required tools and resources for this module are:

- working computer

What do all these maps have in common? For one, they were all made using QGIS.

## Breakdown of the concepts

The maps shown above were all created in QGIS ([https://qgis.org/en/site/](https://qgis.org/en/site/)), a free and open source Geographic Information System (GIS). QGIS can be used with all kinds of spatial data (such as basketball data in the last example) and not just with earth-related geospatial data.

People are able to create wonderful and amazing maps such as the examples above because QGIS is free, open source, and has powerful data management, analysis, and presentation capabilities.

## Main content

### Phase 1 title: Introduction to QGIS and the QGIS Interface

#### **What is QGIS**

**QGIS**, known as Quantum GIS prior to its 2.X release, is a mature, cross-platform, free and open source Geospatial Information System (GIS).

It is an enterprise ready GIS that has features for collecting, storing, analysing, presenting, and managing spatial & non-spatial data. It also integrates well with other existing geospatial technologies and serves as an integral part of any FOSS4G (Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial) stack.

Being cross-platform, QGIS runs on GNU/Linux, macOS, Windows, and even Android.

#### **Release cycle and versions**

QGIS releases and development follow a time based schedule/roadmap ([https://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/roadmap.html](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/roadmap.html)).

A QGIS release is specified by three numbers (X.Y.Z). For example, QGIS 3.16.4.

- X refers to the main version. In this case, QGIS 3.
- Y refers to the release version. In this case release version 16. Release versions are always even numbers since odd numbers are reserved for development versions.
- Z refers to the Point Release (PR) of that version. For 3.16.4, that means it is the 4th point release of the 3.16 version.

There are three main branches of QGIS that users can install. These are the **Long Term Release (LTR)** branch, **Latest Release (LR)** branch, and the **Development (Nightly)** branch.

- **Long Term Release (LTR)** is named that way because it is maintained and receives bug fixes until the next LTR is released. Currently, that means one (1) year. As of February 2021, the current LTR is 3.16.4. This is scheduled to be replaced by QGIS 3.22.4 in February 2022.
- **Latest Release (LR)** refers to the release version of QGIS that contains the most recent or latest features. A new LR is released every four (4) months. For example, a new 3.18 LR was released this February 2021. The next LR (3.20) will be released 4 months from now which is in June 2021. Currently, every 3rd LR becomes the next LTR. For example, the LTR this February 2021 is the 3.16 release. The 3rd LR from 3.16 is 3.22 therefore the next LTR will be based on the 3.22 release version.
- **Development/Nightly** is based on the most recent version of the QGIS source code but is useful if you want to test, debug, or help in the development of QGIS.

So which version should you use? It depends. If you need a version that is maintained for a longer time and you don’t necessarily need new features as they are released then the LTR version might be for you. If you need to have the most recent features and don’t mind doing an upgrade every few months, the LR version just might be for you. Sometimes it’s also good to take a look at the development or nightly versions especially if you are curious or excited about the upcoming features in QGIS.

#### **Installing QGIS**

QGIS is cross-platform and works on Linux, Windows, and macOS. Being open source, you can build and install QGIS from its source code available at [https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/).

Installers and installation instructions are also available at [https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) or [https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html).

For **Linux (or GNU/Linux)**, QGIS is usually available from your distribution’s package manager. For Debian/Ubuntu users, QGIS has repositories for the LR, LTR, and Development branches as well as versions of QGIS with dependencies from the ubuntugis-unstable PPA. QGIS is also available as a Flatpak package or in Conda.

For **Windows**, users can choose between the OSGeo4W Network Installer or the Standalone installers. There’s one Standalone installer for the LTR and LR version.

The Standalone installers are the easiest to install and are recommended for beginners. Multiple versions of QGIS can be installed in your computer at once. This means that you can have both the QGIS 3.16 and 3.18 versions installed.

The OSGeo4W Network Installer is a bit more advanced and complex than the standalone installers but it also gives you the ability to update and upgrade your QGIS version in-place which means that you won’t need to uninstall an older version if you want to install a newer one.

In some cases, you would need administrator rights to install QGIS so if you are installing it on a computer where your user does not have administrator rights, you might need to ask your IT or office administrator to install QGIS for you.

The installation in Windows also comes with QGIS with GRASS (another Free and Open Source GIS).

Note that QGIS is [slowly removing 32-bit support for Windows](https://blog.qgis.org/2020/10/15/phasing-out-32-bit-support-in-qgis/) so it is best to install QGIS on a computer that runs a 64-bit operating system.

For **macOS**, there are official All-in-one signed installers for macOS High Sierra (10.13) and newer. QGIS is not yet notarized as required by macOS Catalina (10.15) security rules. On first launch, please right-click on the QGIS app icon, hold down the Option key, then choose Open.

#### **Parts of the QGIS Interface**

After installing QGIS, you can run or open it as you would any program in your computer. Upon opening QGIS, you will be greeted with the default User Interface (UI) which would look something like below.

![The QGIS interface](media/qgis-interface.png "The QGIS interface")

Figure 1.2. The QGIS Interface on a fresh install

There are six main parts of the QGIS User Interface -- the Menu Bar, Map Canvas, Toolbars, Panels, Status Bar, and the Locator.

At the center of the UI is a Map Canvas. Panels and Toolbars can be positioned around this canvas. Panels can also be docked together to create a multi-tab Panel. There are also other parts of the UI such as the Python Interface, plugin windows, etc.

**Menu Bar** - the Menu bar is a simple hierarchical menu that provides access to QGIS functions and commands. It is usually located at the top of the UI.

**Map Canvas** - the Map Canvas is where layers loaded in QGIS are shown. This is also where filters, selects, and symbologies created by the user are reflected. More than one map canvas can be present at any time. A user can zoom, pan, and even rotate the map canvas. A map canvas can also show 3D data.

**Toolbars** - toolbars show click-and-run buttons. They allow easy access to QGIS commands, features, plugins, etc. They can be moved and docked around the Map Canvas. The list of toolbars can be found, activated, and deactivated from the Menu bar under **View ‣ Toolbars**. Examples of toolbars are the Attributes Toolbar and the Digitizing Toolbar.

**Panels** - panels are similar to toolbars but instead of buttons, they provide an interface to more complex functions and features. The Layer Panel and the Browser Panel are examples. Similar to toolbars, they can be moved and docked around the Map Canvas. The list of panels can be found, activated, and deactivated from the Menu bar under **View ‣ Panels**.

**Status Bar** - the Status Bar is commonly found at the bottom of the UI and shows relevant information such as the CRS, scale, notifications, etc.

**Locator Bar** - the Locator bar is found on the bottom left corner of the QGIS interface. It allows the user to easily access layers, fields, processing algorithms, and other things in QGIS. This is one of the most powerful features of QGIS.
