In fact, QGIS is the combination of the <strong>core</strong> and the <strong>external plugins</strong>. The core plugins - as the name suggests - form the main structure, they are maintained by the QGIS Development Team and they are always included in the installation, such as the Processing core plugin, the Zonal Statistics or the Plugin Manager. Over time, given their relevance, different external plugins migrated towards the core. </p><p>Of course, given the open source principles, coupled with the great and very detailed documentations available and the many communication channels and dedicated events, one can learn how to build a plugin that answers one’s requirements. And that is an <strong>external plugin</strong>. On the dedicated <a href="https://plugins.qgis.org/">web page</a>, you can find all the necessary documentation. Most external plugins are written in Python, but they can also be written in C++. </p><p>In this first phase, we will explore the QGIS plugin setup - how to search for a plugin to solve a specific requirement one might have, how to interpret its documentation and how to report to the developer if you’ve encountered a problem. </p><h3 id="the-plugin-manager"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-plugin-manager"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The Plugin manager</h3><p>QGIS offers a core plugin to allow users to manage, install, update and uninstall external plugins. The functionality is intuitive, providing full access to the official public plugin repository. </p><p>It must be highlighted that the external plugins - be they official or experimental - are the work of individual developers or organizations and the QGIS organization does not take any responsibility for them. That being said, there are some rules that the developers that want to share their work via the official repository, must comply with, as well as a series of recommendations for fast acceptance. Requirements include elements such as a compatible license, minimal documentation, clear identification of dependencies and others. The recommendations include checking if the plugin does not duplicate existing functionality, good shape of the source repository, compatible with all platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS) and many others.  </p><p>Experimental plugins - that are labelled as such in the plugin manager - are plugins that are in early stages of development, that are not suitable for operational use. They are regarded as “proof of concept” testing and users are not advised to install them unless they intend to use them for testing purposes. </p><p>Of course, in order to see the experimental plugins, the user must allow it, Thus in the Plugin manager settings, tick the option <code>Show also experimental plugins</code> (Figure 10.2a). There is also the possibility to list the deprecated plugins. These are not recommended because they are not maintained anymore. </p><p>The two types are well differentiated in Plugin Manager (see figures 10.1 and 10.2b). </p><p><img src="media/fig101.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip"/></p><p>Figure 10.1 - Manager plugin official plugin</p><p><img src="media/fig102_a.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip"/></p><p>Figure 10.2a - Display experimental plugins</p><p><img src="media/fig102_b.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip"/></p><p>Figure 10.2b - Manager plugin experimental plugin</p><p>Another aspect worth mentioning is that the Manager plugin is quite a versatile functionality that allows developers to add they’re private repositories (see figure 10.3). </p><p><img src="media/fig103.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip"/></p><p>Figure 10.3 - Add private plugin repository to your QGIS</p><p>That is useful, if for example, inside your organization there is a need for more plugins, but which do not comply with QGIS requirements for public hosting in their official repository.  A useful resource on how to set up your own plugin repository is available from <a href="https://gis-ops.com/qgis-3-plugin-tutorial-set-up-a-plugin-repository-explained/">GIS OPS</a>. </p><p>The simpler method is to prepare a zip package containing a plugin and that can be shared via traditional ways. However, this method is not encouraged. </p><p>Apart from Settings, one might have noticed that there are several other tabs on the left-hand side, with names that are self-explanatory: <code>All, Installed, Not installed, New, Invalid, Install from ZIP</code> and, as mentioned, <code>Settings</code>. </p><p>After deciding which types of plugins to list in your manager, one can switch to the <code>All</code> tab and let’s investigate how a plugin appears in the Plugin Manager. For demonstration purposes, search the <code>Cartographic Line Generalization</code> plugin.  </p><p>As you have noticed, the Plugin Manager has a search bar available - here is where one can type one or more keywords suitable for a specific requirement. In our case, the keyword is ‘cartographic/cartography’. </p><p><img src="media/fig104.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip"/></p><p>Figure 10.4 - Searching for a specific plugin in the Plugin Manager</p><p>As can be noticed, on the right-hand side there is a window presenting a set of documentation elements. You will notice that these are standardised and each plugin should have the same information made available, in the same way. </p><p>The metadata display for each plugin is as follows: </p><ol><li>Name of plugin and subtitle depicting its capabilities;</li><li>Description section - depending on the developer, this section can be more or less detailed;</li><li>The number of downloads and how many stars has the plugin received from the community;</li><li>The tag words chosen by the developer;</li><li>A series of very important links: the webpage of the plugin, the <strong>bug tracker </strong>and the code repository</li><li>The name of the developer(s), as well as the affiliated organization. Sometimes, the name of the project in which the plugin had been developed is also listed;</li><li>The number of the version, with the mention <em>stable</em> or <em>experimental</em>, depending on the case; </li><li>The pictogram of the plugin.</li></ol><p>In figure 10.5, all mentioned metadata elements are identified. </p><p><img src="media/fig105.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip"/></p><p>Figure 10.5 - Documentation of a plugin</p><p>On the lower left side, the<code> Install plugin</code> button is available. By activating it, the chosen plugin will be installed on your QGIS and a new pictogram or menu will be added to your QGIS interface. </p><p>It is important to mention that usually, due to space limitations, the description available in Plugin Manager is not extensive. So, to best understand if the chosen plugin answers the requirements, one must go to the home page. In our case, we observe that the home page is identical with the code repository - on Gitlab, but this is not always the case (see figure 10.6). </p><p><img src="media/fig106_a.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip"/></p><p>Figure 10.6a - Homepage of selected plugin</p><p><img src="media/fig106_b.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip"/></p><p>Figure 10.6b - Detailed metadata on the plugin homepage</p><p>Another very important aspect to highlight regarding a plugin documentation is the web indication of the <strong>bug tracker</strong>. A bug tracker system is a software application that keeps track of all reported software issues (aka bugs). In our case the bug tracker is supported by the dedicated code repository Github (see figure 10.7).</p><p><img src="media/fig107.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip"/></p><p>Figure 10.7 - Bug tracking system in Github for a QGIS plugin</p><p>Detailing on how to report a software issue on Github exceeds the scope of this module, however it is important to highlight a few aspects. Firstly, the open source ecosystem - be it for geospatial or not - best functions when all involved parties are active in their part, i.e. developers code and users test and report back on issues identified. If one does a quick search on the different bug trackers for <a href="https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues">QGIS</a> or <a href="https://github.com/OSGeo/grass/issues">GRASS</a> or other open source solution, will notice intense activity. And this is a good thing, it shows that the community is alive, that the interaction between developers and users functions normally. Secondly, before opening a bug report via the many different channels, make sure you have thoroughly searched online for a solution to your problem. Otherwise, you risk being scorned for not taking the time to do your homework.  </p><h3 id="phase-2--some-qgis-cool-plugins"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#phase-2--some-qgis-cool-plugins"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Phase 2:  Some QGIS cool plugins</h3><p>Plugins can be classified in multiple categories, depending on what one is considering to be of importance. In the following, we identify the 2:</p><ul><li>By the level of development: <ul><li>Official - the plugin is considered stable, well documented and can be used in production;</li><li>Experimental - the plugin is in early development stage, it is recommended only for testing purposes;</li><li>Deprecated - the plugin is no longer maintained, i.e it will not be updated to newer versions, the developer might not answer to bug reporting, to be used only if there is no other way to solve the issue at hand.</li></ul></li><li>By category type: <ul><li>Vector; </li><li>Raster;</li><li>Web;</li><li>Database;</li><li>Cartography. </li></ul></li></ul><p>It must be noted that some external plugins act like bridges allowing access through QGIS to external databases, clouds,  services in which case, additional elements can be required - such as a paid account to the external service, cloud, or an API key. An example to illustrate this is the Planet Explorer plugin from Planet Inc. (see figure 10.8).</p><p><img src="media/fig108.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip"/></p><p>Figure 10.8 - Example of a plugin that requires external subscription in order for it to function in QGIS to its full capacity</p><p>Although in the description there is no mentioning about it, going to the homepage of the plugin reveals the requirements for it to function: “Planet subscription or trial for accessing and downloading Planet imagery. Don&#x27;t have a subscription? Contact our <a href="https://www.planet.com/contact/">team</a> to learn more.”</p><p>In the following pages, we will identify and provide short examples for a few plugins that we consider could be useful. Please keep in mind that this is a short list of the extensive plugin universe, so feel free to explore beyond. </p><h4 id="discovery"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#discovery"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a><strong>Discovery</strong></h4><p><img src="media/fig109_a.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip"/></p><p>Figure 10.9a - The Discovery plugin</p><p>Discovery is a very useful plugin that allows you to search text stored in the attributes of your vectors. The plugin connects to either a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database, MS SQL Server or a geopackage file and searches for text in the columns indicated. It allows auto-complete and it also supports flexible expression-based support for scales. </p><p>To test it, we will use a geopackage file prepared by The Humanitarian Data Exchange and available for <a href="https://data.humdata.org/dataset/hotosm_phl_north_populated_places">download</a>. It is a vector file containing the populated places from Philippines, together with names, number of people. The raw data has been downloaded from OpenStreetMap. </p><p>After using Plugin Manager, to install Discovery, a new toolbar should be visible on your QGIS. Let us set up the parameters: Data source type: Geopackage, name: Philippines, choose the file accordingly and the layer will be Populated Places, the search column: name. We’ll also request for additional information to be displayed in the search bar: is_in and population. In our situation, if there are more villages with the same name but in different provinces, we will be able to differentiate between them. Your Discovery setup should look like in figure 10.9b. </p><p><img src="media/fig109_b.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip"/></p><p>Figure 10.9b - Setting the Discovery plugin</p><p>Click OK and let us search for “San Roque” in the search bar (see figure 10.9c). </p><p><img src="media/fig109_c.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip"/></p><p>Figure 10.9c - Using Discovery to search fast through the attributes of the vector layers.  </p><p>In our example, we can see that there are many San Roque populated places in the Philippines, choosing one entry in this list and QGIS will zoom in on it (see figure 10.9d).</p><p><img src="media/fig109_d.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip"/></p><p>Figure 10.9d - Zooming in to the geometry of the selected element in the search bar.  </p><p>The plugin offers the possibility to find vectors by text search coupled with various filters, such as a bounding box, or various SQL queries. </p><p>For a detailed description of the plugin capabilities, together with a more comprehensive tutorial, check the Discovery plugin <a href="https://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/projects/discovery/">webpage</a>. </p><h4 id="polygon-divider"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#polygon-divider"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a><strong>Polygon Divider</strong></h4><p><img src="media/fig1010_a.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip"/></p><p>Figure 10.10a - The Polygon Divider plugin</p><p>Polygon Divider is another useful QGIS plugin that assists the user with efficiently dividing it into a number of &#x27;squareish&#x27; polygons of a defined size a vector layer of polygon type.  </p><p>This tool can be useful for a multitude of applications such as land parceling, environmental sampling, and so on.</p><p>Let us use this tool on the Pampanga province dataset and see what results we get. </p><p>Using Plugin Manager, instal the Polygon Divider.

The plugin allows you to automatically load all, at once, but the big advantage is that it provides you with a multitude of filters, such as alphanumeric (by name), data modified, bounding box (coordinates inserted by hand), type of geometry and others. </p><p>To test it, we will load files from previous module 8. For vector, we will choose the shapefiles that have been processed before a selected date, for raster we will choose an alphanumeric filter - the name of the raster loaded should start with LandCover (see figure 10.11_b). </p><p><img src="media/fig1011_b.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip"/></p><p>Figure 10.11b - Setting up the parameters for the Load them All plugin (vectors and rasters)</p><p>The parameters identified above represent an example based on the structure available.

This activity is usually done on scanned older topographic maps from which we want to extract various information to store, process and visualize it in an informational system. A good example is the digitisation done over topographic maps in order to extract contour lines to build in a GIS a 3D model of the relief. </p><p>Although today, with the emergence of digital terrain models obtained from satellite imagery, this might not be an issue anymore, digitisation is still extensively employed. The most prominent use is for extracting information from old maps. Historic maps offer us a window to the past, before we had satellites to monitor our forests and land cover changes. As these cartographic documents were originally on paper, to be able to use the information with modern technology, one must digitise.</p><p>Using Plugins Manager, search and then install Raster Tracer. This plugin adds to QGIS a semi-automatic capability of tracing linear features of the underlying raster map, by clicking on its inflection points on the raster map. Once installed, a new pictogram should appear on your toolbar. </p><p>In order to use it, we need at least 2 layers - one is the raster layer and one is the vector layer that will capture data. We have identified for the Pampanga province a topographic map, 1:50k on the official website of the National Mapping and Resources Information Authority. Unfortunately, although they did provide access to the <a href="http://www.namria.gov.ph/3131-IIIAngelesCity.html">map</a>, it is not georeferenced. For demonstration purposes, we will carry on without correcting this issue, however, please note! Before digitasing vectors from a raster map, it is crucial that the latter is correctly georeferenced. Otherwise, the work - which is quite time-consuming - will be useless. </p><p>That being said, bring in the Angeles City topographic map (<code>Layer - Add layer - Add raster layer..</code>). </p><p>Next, we will create a MultiString vector layer where all the linear objects we extract from the topographic map will be stored (Layer - Create Layer - New GeoPackage layer..). Create a MultiLine vector and save it under the name tracer_lines. Choose the EPSG: 3123 projection - the region’s official projection. Start the editing mode on it (<code>Right click - Toggle editing</code>). </p><p>Click on the RasterTracer pictogram and set up the parameters, like in figure 10.12b. Choose the colour of the contour lines by using the color picker that will open when clicking on the Trace color option. </p><p><img src="media/fig1012_b.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip"/></p><p>Figure 10.12b - Setting up the RasterTracer parameters</p><p>Now, all it is left to do is start digitising. After making sure your vector raster is editable and that the plugin is activated by clicking once more on it, click on the inflection points of the contour line we will extract (see figure 10.112c). </p><p><img src="media/fig1012_c.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip"/></p><p>Figure 10.12c -  Clicking on the inflection points to draw the line using RasterTracer</p><p>Figure 10.12d presents the result. </p><p><img src="media/fig1012_d.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip"/></p><p>Figure 10.12d - Semi-automatically drawn line by following the indicated colour. </p><h4 id="active-fire"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#active-fire"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a><strong>Active Fire</strong></h4><p><img src="media/fig1013_a.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip"/></p><p>Figure 10.13a - The Active Fire plugin</p><p>However plugins are not only designed to work with data that you have, but are built to also bring in our QGIS datasets that are produced by other institutions, agencies, organization or anyone that shares them through web mapping standardised services. </p><p>One good example is the Active Fire plugin. This has been developed to allow QGIS users to quickly, intuitively and without any effort to display fires in the last 24h on any region of interest. The fire products are produced by NASA and made freely available for anyone.

The plugin is based on a Python library named Plotly, that is quite powerful providing the possibility to create multitude of interactive, publication-quality graphs: line plots, scatter plots, area charts, bar charts, error bars, box plots, histograms, heatmaps, subplots, multiple-axes, polar charts, and bubble charts.

It is the user that must define appropriate colours and schemas of the representations. For more information on layers styling, go to module 4. </p><p>To test the table2style plugin, we will use the LandCover2019 raster dataset, used also in module nr.9. By loading the raster into QGIS you should have a restul similar with the one in figure 10.17c.</p><p><img src="media/fig1017_c.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip"/></p><p>Figure 10.17c - QGIS randomly assigns colours to pixel values</p><p>As per the data provider, we know that for each pixel value there is a clearly assigned colour  and in the land cover domain, these colours already represent conventions, just as in classic cartography. Forests are represented with a specific kind of green, pastures with another, ocean is depicted with a different kind of blue than inland surface water and so forth. Worst case would be to manually assign all these colours to their respective values. However, the table2style plugin solves this issue automatically, in a matter of seconds. </p><p>Go to Manager plugin and install the table2style plugin. A new icon will appear on your toolbar. Open it by double clicking it.

As per our table above, we have Hex codes for the assigned colors. Thus, load the table into QGIS (<code>Layer - Add layer - Add delimited text layer… </code>). Of course, it has no geometry. The LandCover values table should look like in figure 10.17e. </p><p><img src="media/fig1017_e.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip"/></p><p>Figure 10.17e - Attribute table with pixel values, color codes and description for Land Cover</p><p>Now, let us take a look at the raster dataset. The table2style works only on a 1-band raster, as it is a one to one connection: pixel value - color code. If more bands are available, judging after the plugin setup window, it would not know which one to choose. However, checking the LandCover2019 layer properties, we notice that there are 3 bands (<code>Properties - Information - scroll down to Bands</code>). As we need only Band 1 - discrete classification, we will employ the raster calculator to extract it (<code>Raster - Raster calculator</code> and insert in the expression field only &quot;LandCover2019_1band@1&quot; - save the result).
